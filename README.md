🌦️ Weather Data Visualizer

A data analysis and visualization mini-project using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes real-world weather data and visualizes key insights such as temperature trends, rainfall totals, and humidity relationships. It demonstrates skills in data cleaning, statistical analysis, grouping/aggregation, and storytelling with visuals.

This project fulfills the requirements of the Mini Project Assignment for
Programming for Problem Solving using Python.

🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this project, you will:

Load and clean real-world weather datasets (CSV).

Handle missing values, convert datatypes, and prepare data.

Use NumPy to compute statistical metrics.

Visualize trends using Matplotlib (line, bar, scatter plots).

Perform grouping and aggregation using Pandas.

Export cleaned data and results.

Present insights in a clear and structured format.
